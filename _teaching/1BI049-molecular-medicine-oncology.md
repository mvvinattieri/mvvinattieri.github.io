2025 - Molecular Medicine - Oncology
(https://education.ki.se/student-at-ki/all-course-and-programme-websites/bachelors-programme-in-biomedicine/molecular-medicine-oncology-15-credits) provides students with the knowledge on causes and consequences of the transformation of a normal cell into a tumor cell. The goal is to create understanding for this process starting with the first injury of the cell and up to the treatment of patients with cancer. The teaching covers areas like basal tumor biology, biostatistics and clinical oncology. 

## Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO)
At the end of the course students will be able to:
- Explain the biological mechanisms of cancer development and their implications for diagnostics and treatment;
- Apply laboratory and epidemiological methods to design, conduct, and interpret cancer research;
- Critically evaluate scientific literature and demonstrate an ethical approach to experimental and clinical investigations.
